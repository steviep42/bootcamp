# Intro to R BootCamp  

&copy; Pittard Consulting of Decatur 2016 

Welcome to the repository associated with the Intro R Bootcamp offered by Pittard 
Consulting of Decatur LLC. This represents all the lectures, code, and labs provided 
as part of this course. We ask that you do not redistribute this information although 
as a student of this course you can download, edit, and use this material in your work 
and learning in perpetuity. I think you will find that R is a great language to accomplish your analytics work and build compelling graphics. At the same time it makes you more marketable. The course is organized over a period of three days from 9 a.m. - 5 p.m. each day with a break for lunch at midday. 

The format is lecture based although there are frequent stops for application of material to insure that students have the opportunity to apply what it is they are learning. 
In reality no programming or analytics language can be learned without hands-on activities. Like a spoken language the more you actually use and apply R (or any language) the better you become. At first it can be challenging to remember the syntax of a function or what arguments a given function might take and that is understandable. In this course I will show you effective shortcuts that help you deal with these problems thus keeping you productive not only in the class but beyond. I will also answer questions during the course though I might choose to handle more involved responses (or those specific to an individual) during lunch break or after that day's session.


# RStudio

In this class we will be using the RStudio IDE (Interface Development Environment) to manage all of our R code. This is a great tool for you to use and in my opinion is the best R Graphical User Interface to use. (Note I have no financial stake in the company that makes it). If you learned R "back in the day" it was quite frustrating to manage your code, output, graphics, and file locations from one tool especially if you were using Apple OSX or Linux. RStudio takes care of all this and more. I've created a separate summary area for it here. The good news is that you will not have to install RStudio for this class since it is pre-installed for you. However, it is easy to install on your laptop which is how I typically prefer to work. In situations requiring more computational power I use resources like the Amazon Web Services though even then I write most of my R code locally and upload it to the cloud for implementation.
